## Module 21

### Project Description

Alphabet Soup requested a tool to help select applicants for funding with the highest chance of success. Neural Network models can be used as binary classifiers to determine whether applicants will be successful or not. This requires labeled data to train and test the model, which was provided by the nonprofit with over 34,000 organizations that received funding, and the proper model parameters to get the best outcome. There were 3 attempts made to optimize the model to reach the target 75% accuracy, one of those attempts utilized Kerasâ€™s Autotuner. Read the Project Analysis file in the root of this repo for a quick breakdown/summary of the project.

### Execution

Execute initial_model, model_auto_optimization, model_optimization1, or model_optimization2 jupyter notebook files in the GetSetGo folder. The model_auto_optimization file also includes a !pip command for installing keras-tuner. The generated outputs and analysis will be made available, models generated saved in H5 format, and the auto tuner will save the models it created to a separate folder named Tuner_trials. 

### Features

Jupyter notebook is used to run the code. Modules included are Keras Tuner, Pandas, TensorFlow, and Sklearn. From Sklearn, the model_selection.StandardScaler and preprocessing.train_test_split functions were used. 

### Contributors

EdX class code and data were used for the entire project.
